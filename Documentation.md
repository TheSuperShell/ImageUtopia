## UI

## Main features

### Collection

Collection - is a folder (created by the app) that contains all the images and meta data.

To create collection User can press a button on the top left of the app and in the flyout menu choose `create new collection`. (#TODO: add description of collection creataion menu). If the User opens the app for the first time, or previously created and opened collection was not found, instead of the main window User will see the collection creation window.

In the root of the collection folder there is an `images` folder and a `metadata.json`.

#### metadata

`metadata.json` is a json file that contains following data:
- folders: a list of all User created [folders](#folders) with their own metadata:
    - id 
    - name
    - description
    - related_tags

#### images folder

`images` folder is filled in with images, each within their own folder with the image id (generated by the app) as the name of the folder. This image folders contain the image itself, `metadata.json` and a preview (compressed) version of the image. Preview image is used in the [image grid](#image-grid) within the app.

- `metadata.json` consists of the image metadata (which is recorded upon image upload and edited by user within the app)
    - id
    - name (image file name)
    - size (in bytes)
    - ext (png, jpg, etc.)
    - tags (list)
    - folders (list)
    - isDeleted
    - width
    - height
    - annotations

### Left column

#### Top left flyout

The menu button is located on the top left of the screen. This is a standart flyout menu with options such as:
- create new collection
- open collection
- settings
- quit

#### Folders

Images are sorted within folders. Almost the whole left side of the app is the vertical list of all folders. Each row of this list shows the name of the folder and the amount of images within it.

Each folder within left column is a button. Upon clicking the image folder, User enters said folder. The [right column](#right-column) now only shows metadata of this column. The [central grid](#center-part) is now filled with images within chosen folder. A chosen folder is highlited.

Each image can be located within multiple columns

There are *system defined* folders, such as:
- all: consists of all images within the [collection](#collection)
- uncategorized: images without user defined folder
- untaged: images without tag
- trash bin: images that were "deleted"

User can create their own folders, give them a name, a description and an assosiated tag(s) (any image within this folder will automaticly receive this tag(s)). User is also able to delete folders. Images within deleted folders are not removed from collection but they lose deleted folder from their metadata.
